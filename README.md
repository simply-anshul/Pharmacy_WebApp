# Hello There!
### This is a sample project to test out the new skills I have learnt!

I am Anshul and I love to code. 
<br/>
This is a simple Web Applications. This is a pharmacy app where one can add, update, delete or simply read all the medications available.
<br/>
This project has tested out my skills in
- [x] Java
- [x] SpringBoot
- [x] REST API
- [x] Hibernate ORM
- [x] MySQL
- [x] CRUD Operations
- [x] Thymeleaf
- [x] Maven

<br/>
You can clone my project. 
<br/>
To Run the project, simple run PharmacyApplication.java as a Java Application. Springboot will handle the rest. It will start the server at port: 8081
<br/>
Go to http://localhost:8081/ and you will encounter an Home page
<br/>
http://localhost:8081/medicine-list gives you the interactive lists of medicines to go through. Feel free to play with it!
